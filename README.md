# Dreams-Of-Deliverance

An open-source top down ARPG focusing on the struggles of working class people in a world with hyper income inequality.

# Project Description
A game with a purpose. To prove that we can make a game with a large team that isnâ€™t funded by corporate means. The game is a top down game similar to Ys origins and The Legend of Zelda with an emphasis on action combat.    

Our game focuses on 3 characters as they struggle with a larger organization to liberate a city from an oppressive plutocratic regime. Each character is planned to have different mechanics and have different starting points in levels.  Our core focus is to get the player invested in the world we create and the people in it.
